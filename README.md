## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for analyzing sentiment in Twitter data.  
It converts raw, unstructured tweets into meaningful predictions using TF-IDF feature engineering and Logistic Regression.

Designed with a strong focus on **deployment, interpretability, and real-world usability**, this system demonstrates how classical NLP techniques can power fast and reliable inference engines.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | **~76%** |
| F1 Score | **0.76** |

Strong performance considering the highly noisy and informal nature of social media text.

## 📁 Dataset

**Sentiment140**

- 1.6 million labeled tweets  
- Binary sentiment classification  
- Real-world Twitter data  

This dataset enables the model to generalize well across diverse writing styles.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

Most machine learning projects stop at model training.

This project goes further by demonstrating **production-oriented ML engineering**, including:

- Model serialization  
- Environment management  
- Cloud deployment  
- Real-time inference  
- User-facing interface  

It reflects the practical skills required to transition from experimentation to shipped ML systems.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Transformer-based models (BERT / DistilBERT)  
- Neutral sentiment classification  
- Real-time tweet ingestion  
- Docker-based deployment  
- CI/CD pipeline
